**#Learning Git & GitHub**
In this introductory course I've learned *Git basics* , *set up*, *cloning* and *navigating through* Github repositories. 
Some seemed complicated at first, but got a lot easier with more practice. I'm not confident with my understanding of
*pull requests* quite yet. 

***#Challenging part***
*Branches and forks when working with others*.
My current understanding is, they function almost similarly in that, you have a separate workspace to make changes, submit a 
pull request, changes are reviewed, and later merged with the default branch.
Are there specific instances when only one option is used and not the other, or can they be used interchangeably?
